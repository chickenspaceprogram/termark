# termark

### A terminal markup language

This project is a compiler of sorts that takes text formatted in a lightweight macro-based markup language, called `termark`.

The goal of this project is to compile `termark` down to a string of characters that can be easily printed from a program written in a language of the user's choosing.

`termark` is heavily inspired by the syntax of LaTeX. Since LaTeX syntax is, frankly, ugly, this is probably a bad move, but I liked the idea of only having to define a few primitives.
